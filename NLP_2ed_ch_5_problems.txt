... from the Brown Corpus Manual:
	"An ellipsis at the end of a sentence, indicated in the text by four periods, is indicated by **H followed by period
	 without intervening space. (An ellipsis is counted as a single word in the word count). Where the text has only three
	 suspension points at the end of a sentence, **H is used without following period."
    It does not say what to do about an ellipsis at the beginning or middle of a sentence.
